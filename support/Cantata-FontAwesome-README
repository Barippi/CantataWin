Cantata-FontAwesome.ttf is a modified version of FontAwesome 4.7 The font file
has been modified so that the family name is now 'Cantata-FontAwesome'

FontAwesome 5.0 is not compatible with FontAwesome 4.x - if a system were to
have FontAwesome 5.0 installed, and Cantata used the system installed font,
then Cantata would have **many** missing icons. Therefore, the only way to
ensure Cantata **always** loads a 4.7 FontAwesome was to bundle a local version
whose name had been changed to be Cantata specific.

FontAwesome is licensed using SIL OFL 1.1 A copy of this license is included
